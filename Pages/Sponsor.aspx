            <h2 class="center">Brampton Sport Center</h2>
            <p>Indoor practice nets differ significantly from outdoor nets. 
                They are often suspended on an aluminium track way (runners) which are fixed to the ceiling of sports hall. 
                The nets can then drop 8–4 meters to reach the ground, before travelling at least 20 meters laterally, 
                which provides a substantial practice enclosure. Indoors nets are commonly multi lane, with 2 or 4 bay nets being particularly common. 
                They have a separate canvas screen which enclose the area immediately surrounding the athlete and rise to a height of 3 meters</p>
